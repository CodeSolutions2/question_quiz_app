# question_quiz_app

The objective of this work was to create a Computer or web application that can present questions and answers to test-takers, grade test-taker performance, and allow for test-takers to view chatbot performance with respect to their performance. Adult professionals, in addition to young people, need to study for and pass career-related exams. A simplistic flash card-like application is useful for many people to practice their study content. There are several question quiz application programs that exist for the computer, cloud, and phone. However, many of the existing applications do not grade the user or record what questions were answered incorrectly for later study. In addition, none of the question quiz applications allow for usage with a chatbot to understand one's study competence with respect to an intelligent robot. There are three tiers of this workflow: PySimpleGUI Python code, JavaScript HTML webapp code, JavaScript HTML webapp w/BigQuery integration code. These code workflows/solutions will be delivered with instructions on how to use the code.
